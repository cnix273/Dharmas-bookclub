Dharma Center Bookstore Search and Suggestion Application

This application is designed to enhance Dharma Center Bookstore’s web presence for consumers. It utilizes the Google Books and New York Times Best Sellers list APIs to function as a sleek and simple search application. Consumers can use the search bar to find a book using the title or author. The application then dynamically creates five book suggestions based on their search parameters. Customers seeking book suggestions also have the ability to view the top five books on the New York Times Best Sellers list. The application also provides users the ability to save books to a favorites list for future reference. 

# Motivation

Dharma, like other small businesses, functions mainly on a brick and mortar basis. Larger companies and competitors, such as Barnes & Noble, dominate the virtual world. In a market where brick and mortar is dying out and being largely replaced by ecommerce, small businesses like Dharma need to improve their web presence in order to survive and thrive.
